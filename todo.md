# TODO for my dotfiles

- Fix wlogout (execute `wlogout` check out that ugly mofo)
- Screenshot manager
- TUI/GUI calculator
- Update Hyprland `colors.conf` after `wal` was ran in ~/.local/share/wallpapers/bin/set-wallpaper.sh
- Integrate [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) for a nice desktop widget system.
- Initial color-scheme if `~/.config/wal` doesn't exist yet. (Maybe run it with a version controlled image)
