# TODO for my dotfiles

- wlogout's icon colors should conform to wal's colors. I couldn't figure it out initially. (css skill issue)
- When clicking on the audio portion of the status bar, it should open `wiremix` in a floating terminal window
- Screenshot manager
- TUI/GUI calculator
- Integrate [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) for a nice desktop widget system.
- Initial color-scheme if `~/.config/wal` doesn't exist yet. (Maybe run it with a version controlled image)
- Use [wallhaven's API](https://wallhaven.cc/help/api) to create a picker to change wallpapers.
- Hyprland cursor
